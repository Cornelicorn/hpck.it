Description: Adapt tox configuration to RPM build environments
 requirements. The %pyproject_buildrequires macro does not detect build
 requirements declared pyproject.toml namespace packages. Then
 dependencies are declared in tox configuration so that
 %pyproject_buildrequires with -t options install them anyway. Not that
 pytest-sugar is removed as it is not available in el9. Also
 remove command_pre with pip install that is not supported nor required
 in RPM build environments
